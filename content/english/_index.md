        - Function to return 403 Forbidden if user-agent = known AI crawler bot.
        - Function to rewrite URI when Orgin = S3; needed for in-bucket versioning.

        - _Blog entries will be created shortly to describe ingress for this static site and its <br> CI/CD pipeline._ 
    - point: Website development and deployment are fully driven by Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Project code is stored in GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/v6Org01/jlv6"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/v6Org01%2Fjlv6-%23000000.svg?logo=github&logoColor=white" alt="GitHub/jlv6 Badge"></a>.
      subpoints:
        - "<u>Main branch</u>: GitHub Action workflows, Terraform config files, Docker files,  ArgoCD application manifests and /public dir."
        - "<u>Development branch</u>: Hugo theme files and script to push /public to main."
    - point: Not SEO-optimized, no advertisements, no third-party cookies, no user profiling, no data collection. The Private Policy can be found <a href="https://www.jlv6.com/privacy-policy" class="a1">here</a>.
    - point: A huge thank you! This website would not have been possible without the incredible contributions to the Hugo framework and the Hugoplate theme, developed by Zeon Studio.
